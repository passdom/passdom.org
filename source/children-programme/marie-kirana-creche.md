**MARIE KIRANA CRÈCHE**

**Marie Kirana Crèche **was started in the year 1992 by the Dominican Sisters of the Presentation in favor of domestic mothers’ children. It enrolls children aged 2 years to 5 years, here children are admitted from pre-nursery to UKG. By this, we ensure the domestic working mothers to continue to earn their livelihood by leaving their children at our center. Thus, children have opportunity to early learning and childhood growth appropriate to their age while in our crèche.

**Every year, the crèche begins in the month of June and closes in the month of April.**

We have dedicated staff and sisters rendering their quality services in the crèche.
