**ANNUAL EDUCATION AID TO POOR CHILDREN **

**AND EVENING TUITION CHILDREN**

** **

*   **ANNUAL EDUCATION AID:**
While working in slums, we found many dropouts and poor households unable send their children to formal school, are financially assisted to mainstream them to schools. We have survey conducted in all these slums and select the appropriate students. After applications are submitted, we visit the school regularly to ensure the student continues to study.

Presently, we are assisting 173 poor children towards their education aid such as school fee, uniform, shoes, and note books, school bags, etc.

*   **EVENING TUITION CLASSES**
**_This year 173 children from 1<sup>st</sup> STD to 10<sup>th</sup> standard are attending daily evening tuition classes. _**

In order to ensure that all supported children continued their education and improved their academic performances, we made it mandatory for them to attend evening tuition classes that are held from Monday to Friday for an hour in the evening and participate in Children’s parliament programmes. Secondly we focus also on developing extracurricular activities, develop skills, talents, among these students.

**SOCIAL AWARENESS &amp; ANNUAL EDUCATION TOURS FOR CHILDREN**

*   **ANNUAL EDUCATION TOURS **
It is unfortunate the parents in Bangalore are so busy and worried about supplying basic needs of the families and children that they rarely think of providing social outings, entertainment for their children. From morning to evening and Monday to Saturday s they keep on working that they taken one day off to relax themselves by washing their dresses, cleaning houses, etc. These situations deprive and affect their children.

Sensing the need, PASS organizes every year one social outing to some historical and key places and makes children really enjoyable and memorable.

*   **SOCIAL AWARENESS PROGRAMME**
Children are pro actors in social awareness like cleanliness, environment, health, social responsibilities, etc, through Shramadhan day programmes in slums.

Children pick up equipments, put up skits, invite volunteers, and clean up slums, drainages, sweep, etc. Every year, at least one Shramadhan day programmes are organized to sensitize public on environment, cleanliness, and health through these events.
